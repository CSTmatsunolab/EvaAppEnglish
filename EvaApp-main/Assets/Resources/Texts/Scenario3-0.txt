&You「I wonder how long the blackouts will last.... It's so dark at night without electricity...... .」
&Hina「It's really dark... I can only rely on the light of a candle.」
&You「I'm already using my current candle for the last time... What should I do when I finish using my current candle?」
&Hina「You can use canned tuna as a light in addition to candles.」
&You「Canned tuna?」
&Hina「Yeah. Canned tuna is soaked in oil, and that oil is what makes it catch fire.」
&You「I see. But I can't put it as a lamp, even if it lights up...」
&Hina「No, I don't think so. It's getting dark around here, and I'm actually going to make a lamp out of a can of tuna, so watch closely.」
&You「Ok!!!!!!!」
&Hina「First, I will make the core of the lamp by cutting a tissue in half.」
&Hina「The length should be about 2.5 times the height of the can of tuna.」
&Hina「Next, make a hole in a can of tuna large enough to allow the core you just made to stick through.」
&Hina「So, stick a tissue in the hole you drilled, and you've got yourself a canned tuna lamp!」

&You「That's pretty easy! Can I light a fire?」
&Hina「All right.」
&You「Oh! It really looks like a lamp! Now we have a candle substitute!」
&Hina「You can eat the canned tuna when you're done using it as a light.」
&You「I see what you mean! So canned tuna can be both food and light!」
