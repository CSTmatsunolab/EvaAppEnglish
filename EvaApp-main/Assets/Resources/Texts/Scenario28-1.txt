&HINA「Hey, isn't that emergency food expired?」
&YOU「Yes, but I brought it all the way here, so I didn't want to waste it. ......」

&YOU「Ah, but it looks like water requires a different kind of attention.」
&HINA「Is that so?」
&YOU「In the case of water, there is an expiration date on it, but it seems that it's not about the taste, but about the approximate date when the content will be reduced.」
&YOU「They say that if stored properly and unopened, even products that are well past their expiration date are safe.」
&HINA「I see! So if you're careful about storing water, you're safe.」
